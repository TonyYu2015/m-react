# State

1. Create State
2. Update State
>we know if we want to update a FunctionComponent, will use a function returned from state hooks, here we introduce it.

## Create State
`useState` will be treated as `mountState`, here is the function

```javascript
function mountState<S>(
  initialState: (() => S) | S,
): [S, Dispatch<BasicStateAction<S>>] {
    // return a new hook
  const hook = mountWorkInProgressHook();
  if (typeof initialState === 'function') {
    // $FlowFixMe: Flow doesn't like mixed types
    initialState = initialState();
  }
  // assign the initialState
  hook.memoizedState = hook.baseState = initialState;
  const queue = (hook.queue = {
    pending: null,
    dispatch: null,
    lastRenderedReducer: basicStateReducer,
    lastRenderedState: (initialState: any),
  });
  const dispatch: Dispatch<
    BasicStateAction<S>,
  > = (queue.dispatch = (dispatchAction.bind(
    null,
    currentlyRenderingFiber,
    queue,
  ): any));
  return [hook.memoizedState, dispatch];
}
```

## Update state
`useState` will be treated as `updateState`
```javascript
function updateState<S>(
  initialState: (() => S) | S,
): [S, Dispatch<BasicStateAction<S>>] {
  return updateReducer(basicStateReducer, (initialState: any));
}
```
we can see that `updateState` will call the `updateReducer` directly, so it is a simple example of reducer.

```javascript
function updateReducer<S, I, A>(
  reducer: (S, A) => S,
  initialArg: I,
  init?: I => S,
): [S, Dispatch<A>] {
  const hook = updateWorkInProgressHook();
  const queue = hook.queue;

  queue.lastRenderedReducer = reducer;

  const current: Hook = (currentHook: any);

  // The last rebase update that is NOT part of the base state.
  let baseQueue = current.baseQueue;

  // The last pending update that hasn't been processed yet.
  const pendingQueue = queue.pending;
  if (pendingQueue !== null) {
    // We have new updates that haven't been processed yet.
    // We'll add them to the base queue.
    if (baseQueue !== null) {
      // Merge the pending queue and the base queue.
      const baseFirst = baseQueue.next;
      const pendingFirst = pendingQueue.next;
      baseQueue.next = pendingFirst;
      pendingQueue.next = baseFirst;
    }
    current.baseQueue = baseQueue = pendingQueue;
    queue.pending = null;
  }

  if (baseQueue !== null) {
    // We have a queue to process.
    const first = baseQueue.next;
    let newState = current.baseState;

    let newBaseState = null;
    let newBaseQueueFirst = null;
    let newBaseQueueLast = null;
    let update = first;
    do {
      const updateLane = update.lane;
      if (!isSubsetOfLanes(renderLanes, updateLane)) {
        // Priority is insufficient. Skip this update. If this is the first
        // skipped update, the previous update/state is the new base
        // update/state.
        const clone: Update<S, A> = {
          lane: updateLane,
          action: update.action,
          eagerReducer: update.eagerReducer,
          eagerState: update.eagerState,
          next: (null: any),
        };
        if (newBaseQueueLast === null) {
          newBaseQueueFirst = newBaseQueueLast = clone;
          newBaseState = newState;
        } else {
          newBaseQueueLast = newBaseQueueLast.next = clone;
        }
        // Update the remaining priority in the queue.
        // TODO: Don't need to accumulate this. Instead, we can remove
        // renderLanes from the original lanes.
        currentlyRenderingFiber.lanes = mergeLanes(
          currentlyRenderingFiber.lanes,
          updateLane,
        );
        markSkippedUpdateLanes(updateLane);
      } else {
        // This update does have sufficient priority.

        if (newBaseQueueLast !== null) {
          const clone: Update<S, A> = {
            // This update is going to be committed so we never want uncommit
            // it. Using NoLane works because 0 is a subset of all bitmasks, so
            // this will never be skipped by the check above.
            lane: NoLane,
            action: update.action,
            eagerReducer: update.eagerReducer,
            eagerState: update.eagerState,
            next: (null: any),
          };
          newBaseQueueLast = newBaseQueueLast.next = clone;
        }

        // Process this update.
        if (update.eagerReducer === reducer) {
          // If this update was processed eagerly, and its reducer matches the
          // current reducer, we can use the eagerly computed state.
          newState = ((update.eagerState: any): S);
        } else {
          const action = update.action;
          newState = reducer(newState, action);
        }
      }
      update = update.next;
    } while (update !== null && update !== first);

    if (newBaseQueueLast === null) {
      newBaseState = newState;
    } else {
      newBaseQueueLast.next = (newBaseQueueFirst: any);
    }

    // Mark that the fiber performed work, but only if the new state is
    // different from the current state.
    if (!is(newState, hook.memoizedState)) {
      markWorkInProgressReceivedUpdate();
    }

    hook.memoizedState = newState;
    hook.baseState = newBaseState;
    hook.baseQueue = newBaseQueueLast;

    queue.lastRenderedState = newState;
  }

  const dispatch: Dispatch<A> = (queue.dispatch: any);
  return [hook.memoizedState, dispatch];
}
```

## Fire an update from set new state
All the update function from state hooks will call a function named `dispatchAction`.
>ignore some dev and unrelated code.
```javascript
function dispatchAction<S, A>(
  fiber: Fiber,
  queue: UpdateQueue<S, A>,
  action: A,
) {
  const eventTime = requestEventTime();
  const lane = requestUpdateLane(fiber);

  const update: Update<S, A> = {
    lane,
    action,
    eagerReducer: null,
    eagerState: null,
    next: (null: any),
  };

  // Append the update to the end of the list.
  const pending = queue.pending;
  if (pending === null) {
    // This is the first update. Create a circular list.
    update.next = update;
  } else {
    update.next = pending.next;
    pending.next = update;
  }
  queue.pending = update;

  const alternate = fiber.alternate;
  if (
    fiber === currentlyRenderingFiber ||
    (alternate !== null && alternate === currentlyRenderingFiber)
  ) {
    // This is a render phase update. Stash it in a lazily-created map of
    // queue -> linked list of updates. After this render pass, we'll restart
    // and apply the stashed updates on top of the work-in-progress hook.
    didScheduleRenderPhaseUpdateDuringThisPass = didScheduleRenderPhaseUpdate = true;
  } else {
    if (
      fiber.lanes === NoLanes &&
      (alternate === null || alternate.lanes === NoLanes)
    ) {
      // The queue is currently empty, which means we can eagerly compute the
      // next state before entering the render phase. If the new state is the
      // same as the current state, we may be able to bail out entirely.
      const lastRenderedReducer = queue.lastRenderedReducer;
      if (lastRenderedReducer !== null) {
        let prevDispatcher;
        try {
          const currentState: S = (queue.lastRenderedState: any);
          const eagerState = lastRenderedReducer(currentState, action);
          // Stash the eagerly computed state, and the reducer used to compute
          // it, on the update object. If the reducer hasn't changed by the
          // time we enter the render phase, then the eager state can be used
          // without calling the reducer again.
          update.eagerReducer = lastRenderedReducer;
          update.eagerState = eagerState;
          if (is(eagerState, currentState)) {
            // Fast path. We can bail out without scheduling React to re-render.
            // It's still possible that we'll need to rebase this update later,
            // if the component re-renders for a different reason and by that
            // time the reducer has changed.
            return;
          }
        } catch (error) {
          // Suppress the error. It will throw again in the render phase.
        } finally {
        }
      }
    }
    // enter the reconciler process.
    scheduleUpdateOnFiber(fiber, lane, eventTime);
  }


}
