# Introduction
We know hooks had been a very important part of react after it was appended into react, and also run very well in our daliy develop tasks. I think we can use it much better if we know the theory of how the hooks work in the process.

##  Properties in Fiber related to hooks
```
WorkInProgressHook: Hook, will be set null after FunctionComponent run
currentHook: Hook, 

Hook = {
    memoizedState: any, stored state
    baseState: any, initial state
    baseQueue: Queue,
    queue: Queue,
    next: Hook, next hook in the  hook linked list
}

Fiber = {
    memoizedState: Hook,  hook linked list (include all hooks)
    updateQueue: Hook, effect linked list (only effect hooks), will be used in the commit stage
}
```
`renderWithHooks` is the render function of FunctionComponent, the logic inside the function is very clear. beofre the 
FunctionComponent run, run the FunctionCompoent, and after the run of the FunctionComponent.

```
function renderWithHooks(
  current: Fiber | null,
  workInProgress: Fiber,
  Component: (p: Props, arg: SecondArg) => any,
  props: Props,
  secondArg: SecondArg,
  nextRenderLanes: Lanes,
): any {
  renderLanes = nextRenderLanes;
  currentlyRenderingFiber = workInProgress;

  // reset related properties
  workInProgress.memoizedState = null;
  workInProgress.updateQueue = null;
  workInProgress.lanes = NoLanes;

    // assign different dispatcher function in different stages (mount and update)
    ReactCurrentDispatcher.current =
      current === null || current.memoizedState === null
        ? HooksDispatcherOnMount
        : HooksDispatcherOnUpdate;

  // run the FunctionComponent
  let children = Component(props, secondArg);

  // Check if there was a render phase update
  if (didScheduleRenderPhaseUpdateDuringThisPass) {
    // Keep rendering in a loop for as long as render phase updates continue to
    // be scheduled. Use a counter to prevent infinite loops.
    let numberOfReRenders: number = 0;
    do {
      didScheduleRenderPhaseUpdateDuringThisPass = false;
      invariant(
        numberOfReRenders < RE_RENDER_LIMIT,
        'Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent ' +
          'an infinite loop.',
      );

      numberOfReRenders += 1;

      // Start over from the beginning of the list
      currentHook = null;
      workInProgressHook = null;

      workInProgress.updateQueue = null;

      ReactCurrentDispatcher.current = __DEV__
        ? HooksDispatcherOnRerenderInDEV
        : HooksDispatcherOnRerender;

      children = Component(props, secondArg);
    } while (didScheduleRenderPhaseUpdateDuringThisPass);
  }

  // We can assume the previous dispatcher is always this one, since we set it
  // at the beginning of the render phase and there's no re-entrancy.
  ReactCurrentDispatcher.current = ContextOnlyDispatcher;

  // This check uses currentHook so that it works the same in DEV and prod bundles.
  // hookTypesDev could catch more cases (e.g. context) but only in DEV bundles.
  const didRenderTooFewHooks =
    currentHook !== null && currentHook.next !== null;

  renderLanes = NoLanes;
  currentlyRenderingFiber = (null: any);

  currentHook = null;
  workInProgressHook = null;

  didScheduleRenderPhaseUpdate = false;

  invariant(
    !didRenderTooFewHooks,
    'Rendered fewer hooks than expected. This may be caused by an accidental ' +
      'early return statement.',
  );

  return children;
}
```

inside the FunctionComponent run:

before introduce the hooks function, we should know `mountWorkInProgressHook` and `updateWorkInProgressHook`, the two 
functions will be called in mount and update stages respectivly, they will return a new hook or an existed hook.

very simple in the mount function, create a new hook, assign it to workInProgressHook and fiber.memoizedState if not existed,
or assign it to the current workInProgressHook's next, and move the workInProgressHook to the new hook.


```
function mountWorkInProgressHook(): Hook {
  const hook: Hook = {
    memoizedState: null,

    baseState: null,
    baseQueue: null,
    queue: null,

    next: null,
  };

  if (workInProgressHook === null) {
    // This is the first hook in the list
    currentlyRenderingFiber.memoizedState = workInProgressHook = hook;
  } else {
    // Append to the end of the list
    workInProgressHook = workInProgressHook.next = hook;
  }
  return workInProgressHook;
}
```

the update function will move workInProgressHook and currentHook to next.

```
function updateWorkInProgressHook(): Hook {
  // This function is used both for updates and for re-renders triggered by a
  // render phase update. It assumes there is either a current hook we can
  // clone, or a work-in-progress hook from a previous render pass that we can
  // use as a base. When we reach the end of the base list, we must switch to
  // the dispatcher used for mounts.
  let nextCurrentHook: null | Hook;
  if (currentHook === null) {
    const current = currentlyRenderingFiber.alternate;
    if (current !== null) {
      nextCurrentHook = current.memoizedState;
    } else {
      nextCurrentHook = null;
    }
  } else {
    nextCurrentHook = currentHook.next;
  }

  let nextWorkInProgressHook: null | Hook;
  if (workInProgressHook === null) {
    nextWorkInProgressHook = currentlyRenderingFiber.memoizedState;
  } else {
    nextWorkInProgressHook = workInProgressHook.next;
  }

  if (nextWorkInProgressHook !== null) {
    // There's already a work-in-progress. Reuse it.
    workInProgressHook = nextWorkInProgressHook;
    nextWorkInProgressHook = workInProgressHook.next;

    currentHook = nextCurrentHook;
  } else {
    // Clone from the current hook.

    invariant(
      nextCurrentHook !== null,
      'Rendered more hooks than during the previous render.',
    );
    // move to nextCurrentHook
    currentHook = nextCurrentHook;

    const newHook: Hook = {
      memoizedState: currentHook.memoizedState,

      baseState: currentHook.baseState,
      baseQueue: currentHook.baseQueue,
      queue: currentHook.queue,

      next: null,
    };

    if (workInProgressHook === null) {
      // This is the first hook in the list.
      currentlyRenderingFiber.memoizedState = workInProgressHook = newHook;
    } else {
      // Append to the end of the list.
      workInProgressHook = workInProgressHook.next = newHook;
    }
  }
  return workInProgressHook;
}
```

1. here we can learn why we should not use hooks in a condition statement, because it will rebuild the workInprogressHook linkd
list based on the currentHook linked list, so it may confuse the order if a hook is not the same in the same place. 
2. and don'tupdate the state inside the FunctionComponent as much as possible to avoid reach the limition of render times(25).

1. mount stage

`useState` will be treated as `mountState`, here is the function

```
function mountState<S>(
  initialState: (() => S) | S,
): [S, Dispatch<BasicStateAction<S>>] {
    // return a new hook
  const hook = mountWorkInProgressHook();
  if (typeof initialState === 'function') {
    // $FlowFixMe: Flow doesn't like mixed types
    initialState = initialState();
  }
  // assign the initialState
  hook.memoizedState = hook.baseState = initialState;
  const queue = (hook.queue = {
    pending: null,
    dispatch: null,
    lastRenderedReducer: basicStateReducer,
    lastRenderedState: (initialState: any),
  });
  const dispatch: Dispatch<
    BasicStateAction<S>,
  > = (queue.dispatch = (dispatchAction.bind(
    null,
    currentlyRenderingFiber,
    queue,
  ): any));
  return [hook.memoizedState, dispatch];
}
```
`useEffect` will be treated as `mountEffect`

```
function mountEffect(
  create: () => (() => void) | void,
  deps: Array<mixed> | void | null,
): void {
    // ignore the dev code
    return mountEffectImpl(
      PassiveEffect | PassiveStaticEffect,
      HookPassive,
      create,
      deps,
    );
}
```

```
function mountEffectImpl(fiberFlags, hookFlags, create, deps): void {
  const hook = mountWorkInProgressHook();
  const nextDeps = deps === undefined ? null : deps;
  currentlyRenderingFiber.flags |= fiberFlags;
  hook.memoizedState = pushEffect(
    HookHasEffect | hookFlags,
    create,
    undefined,
    nextDeps,
  );
}
```


2. update stage
`useState` will be treated as `updateState`
```
function updateState<S>(
  initialState: (() => S) | S,
): [S, Dispatch<BasicStateAction<S>>] {
  return updateReducer(basicStateReducer, (initialState: any));
}
```
```
function updateReducer<S, I, A>(
  reducer: (S, A) => S,
  initialArg: I,
  init?: I => S,
): [S, Dispatch<A>] {
  const hook = updateWorkInProgressHook();
  const queue = hook.queue;

  queue.lastRenderedReducer = reducer;

  const current: Hook = (currentHook: any);

  // The last rebase update that is NOT part of the base state.
  let baseQueue = current.baseQueue;

  // The last pending update that hasn't been processed yet.
  const pendingQueue = queue.pending;
  if (pendingQueue !== null) {
    // We have new updates that haven't been processed yet.
    // We'll add them to the base queue.
    if (baseQueue !== null) {
      // Merge the pending queue and the base queue.
      const baseFirst = baseQueue.next;
      const pendingFirst = pendingQueue.next;
      baseQueue.next = pendingFirst;
      pendingQueue.next = baseFirst;
    }
    current.baseQueue = baseQueue = pendingQueue;
    queue.pending = null;
  }

  if (baseQueue !== null) {
    // We have a queue to process.
    const first = baseQueue.next;
    let newState = current.baseState;

    let newBaseState = null;
    let newBaseQueueFirst = null;
    let newBaseQueueLast = null;
    let update = first;
    do {
      const updateLane = update.lane;
      if (!isSubsetOfLanes(renderLanes, updateLane)) {
        // Priority is insufficient. Skip this update. If this is the first
        // skipped update, the previous update/state is the new base
        // update/state.
        const clone: Update<S, A> = {
          lane: updateLane,
          action: update.action,
          eagerReducer: update.eagerReducer,
          eagerState: update.eagerState,
          next: (null: any),
        };
        if (newBaseQueueLast === null) {
          newBaseQueueFirst = newBaseQueueLast = clone;
          newBaseState = newState;
        } else {
          newBaseQueueLast = newBaseQueueLast.next = clone;
        }
        // Update the remaining priority in the queue.
        // TODO: Don't need to accumulate this. Instead, we can remove
        // renderLanes from the original lanes.
        currentlyRenderingFiber.lanes = mergeLanes(
          currentlyRenderingFiber.lanes,
          updateLane,
        );
        markSkippedUpdateLanes(updateLane);
      } else {
        // This update does have sufficient priority.

        if (newBaseQueueLast !== null) {
          const clone: Update<S, A> = {
            // This update is going to be committed so we never want uncommit
            // it. Using NoLane works because 0 is a subset of all bitmasks, so
            // this will never be skipped by the check above.
            lane: NoLane,
            action: update.action,
            eagerReducer: update.eagerReducer,
            eagerState: update.eagerState,
            next: (null: any),
          };
          newBaseQueueLast = newBaseQueueLast.next = clone;
        }

        // Process this update.
        if (update.eagerReducer === reducer) {
          // If this update was processed eagerly, and its reducer matches the
          // current reducer, we can use the eagerly computed state.
          newState = ((update.eagerState: any): S);
        } else {
          const action = update.action;
          newState = reducer(newState, action);
        }
      }
      update = update.next;
    } while (update !== null && update !== first);

    if (newBaseQueueLast === null) {
      newBaseState = newState;
    } else {
      newBaseQueueLast.next = (newBaseQueueFirst: any);
    }

    // Mark that the fiber performed work, but only if the new state is
    // different from the current state.
    if (!is(newState, hook.memoizedState)) {
      markWorkInProgressReceivedUpdate();
    }

    hook.memoizedState = newState;
    hook.baseState = newBaseState;
    hook.baseQueue = newBaseQueueLast;

    queue.lastRenderedState = newState;
  }

  const dispatch: Dispatch<A> = (queue.dispatch: any);
  return [hook.memoizedState, dispatch];
}
```
`useEffect` will be treated as `updateEffect`
```
function updateEffect(
  create: () => (() => void) | void,
  deps: Array<mixed> | void | null,
): void {
  return updateEffectImpl(PassiveEffect, HookPassive, create, deps);
}
```

```
function updateEffectImpl(fiberFlags, hookFlags, create, deps): void {
  const hook = updateWorkInProgressHook();
  const nextDeps = deps === undefined ? null : deps;
  let destroy = undefined;

  if (currentHook !== null) {
    const prevEffect = currentHook.memoizedState;
    destroy = prevEffect.destroy;
    if (nextDeps !== null) {
      const prevDeps = prevEffect.deps;
      if (areHookInputsEqual(nextDeps, prevDeps)) {
        pushEffect(hookFlags, create, destroy, nextDeps);
        return;
      }
    }
  }

  currentlyRenderingFiber.flags |= fiberFlags;

  hook.memoizedState = pushEffect(
    HookHasEffect | hookFlags,
    create,
    destroy,
    nextDeps,
  );
}
```

`pushEffect` will be used both in mount and update stages.
```
function pushEffect(tag, create, destroy, deps) {
  const effect: Effect = {
    tag,
    create,
    destroy,
    deps,
    // Circular
    next: (null: any),
  };
  let componentUpdateQueue: null | FunctionComponentUpdateQueue = (currentlyRenderingFiber.updateQueue: any);
  if (componentUpdateQueue === null) {
    componentUpdateQueue = createFunctionComponentUpdateQueue();
    currentlyRenderingFiber.updateQueue = (componentUpdateQueue: any);
    componentUpdateQueue.lastEffect = effect.next = effect;
  } else {
    const lastEffect = componentUpdateQueue.lastEffect;
    if (lastEffect === null) {
      componentUpdateQueue.lastEffect = effect.next = effect;
    } else {
      const firstEffect = lastEffect.next;
      lastEffect.next = effect;
      effect.next = firstEffect;
      componentUpdateQueue.lastEffect = effect;
    }
  }
  return effect;
}
```
> add the effect to the hook linked list and updateQueue
